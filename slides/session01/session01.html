# Overview

.font150[
* Why plain text?

* Reproducibility, flexibility, and control

* (R)Markdown basics: how to write awesome documents with minimal effort 

* Git basics: add, commit, push, pull, merge

* GitHub: git on the cloud

* Homework

# Why plain text? 
 
 .font150[
* Plain text is just text without any tags or special formatting

* Plain text has been around for as long as computers have

* They're interoperable, easy to read and write, lightweight, and backward/forward-compatible

* Many open source tools handle pure text very well, and they're the most powerful tools we have for many tasks, such as
	- Text editing: LaTeX, Markdown
	- Statistical analysis: R
	- General computing: Python, C, etc
]

---

# Why plain text?  

.font150[
* Plain text is useful for researchers for other reasons too

* You can open them in virtually every computer, which increases research reproducibility

* As they can be read with open source software, we can reproduce our research for free

* You can also track every change in the file, which increases transparency

* Remember that the first person who will reproduce your code is _yourself in the future_
]

# Why plain text?   

.font150[
* In a nutshell, plain text:
	- Improves reproducibility
	- Increases transparency
	- Works with the best software
	- Is free!]
--

.font150[
* To sum up:
	- _Plain text = good_
	- _Office = bad_

* You will learn how to use plain text today!

# (R)Markdown

&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=800px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

# (R)Markdown 

.font140[
* Markdown is a simple document markup language with formatting in pure text

* It can be easily converted to many other formats, such as `pdf`, `docx`, `html`, `epub`, and many others using [pandoc](http://pandoc.org)

* It is also _very easy_ to use: One can learn the basics in just a few minutes (!)

* [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is just a version of markdown with some cool `R` features, such as embedded graphs, transparent reports, etc

* We will use markdown _in all papers we will write together_]

---

# (R)Markdown basics

.font140[
* The easiest way to learn markdown is to see a markdown-formatted file]

# RMarkdown templates

.font150[
* To make our life easier, I've already uploaded a series of pre-formatted templates for RMarkdown

* Here: &lt;https://github.com/danilofreire/rmarkdown-templates&gt;

* We will use the article template very often. It should work out of the box

* You can download the zip file on GitHub, then open the contents in [RStudio](http://rstudio.com)

* But you will need to install [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and [pandoc](pandoc.org) first]

---

# RMarkdown templates 

.font150[
* After installing the required software, go to RStudio and install the following package:


```r
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

* Then just click on the `knit` buttom and voil√†!

* If you have any questions about RMarkdown formatting, just google your issue and you will surely find an answer to it

* Or just look at the examples in the [template repository](https://github.com/danilofreire/rmarkdown-templates) to see how to write something you need

# Git

.font150[
* Git is a version for software code control

* That is, it allows users to write, compare, integrate, and check their code

* Developed by Linus Torvalds of Linux fame, it is used by virtually every tech company in the world

* Increasingly used by scholars too

* It is _fully transparent_ as all changes in the code are permanently recorded, and it allows for full reproducibility as one can move to any point in the development history
]

---

# Configuring git and adding files

.font120[
* Install it [here](https://git-scm.com/)

* Setup:

```
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

* Create a git repository:

```
cd /Users/user/my_project
git init
```

* Add files

```
git add cool-markdown-text.md
git commit -am "add markdown file with introduction"
```

* Your file is already tracked by git! But we need to upload it so others can see it...]

---

# GitHub

.font150[
* We will upload our files to [GitHub repositories](http://github.com) 

* GitHub is a platform where people share their code

* Many great projects are hosted there, such as [Linux](github.com/torvals/linux), [Android](https://github.com/android), [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin), and even [the original code of the Apollo 11 mission!](https://github.com/chrislgarry/apollo-11)

* Your code will be in great company!

* _We will use GitHub for all projects we will do together_
]

---

# GitHub 

.font150[
* After you create an account on GitHub, you can either create a new repository or fork (copy) an existing one

* Let's clone this course repository:

.center[![:scale 100%](git-clone.png)]

```
git clone https://github.com/danilofreire/umbertolandia.git
```
]

---

# Uploading files to GitHub

.font120[
* Now that we have our repository, imagine you want to change the `README.md` file within the folder

* You open it in RStudio and modify it as you wish. Then, type:

```
git add README.md
git commit -am "fixed a few typos in the header"
git push origin master
```

* And the file will be online in the `master` branch!

* To upload your files to a new repository, create one on GitHub first then follow their instructions. They're almost the same as those above

* If your colleague updated one or more files and uploaded them into the repository, you can update your local folder with 

```
git pull
```
]

---

# Fork, branch, and merge

.font140[
* You can also create your own copy of an existing repository with _forks_

* They're super easy to do on GitHub:

* Go to the repository website and click on the `Fork` buttom: GitHub will create your copy and you can modify it as you wish]

.center[![:scale 90%](torvalds.png)]

---

# Fork, branch, and merge

* If you're working on a project by yourself, you can upload all changes to the `master` branch

* But if you work with more people, it is recommended that you make your own changes first, test them, and upload them to _your branch_. 

* A branch is a copy of the repository that does not affect the `master` branch, but can be integrated into/from it if necessary

* To create a new branch and work on it, type:

```
git checkout -b my-new-branch
(make your changes)
git add .
git commit -am "my changes"
git push origin my-new-branch
```
* These commands will only affect your branch of the code. If you think they're good to go, you can merge them with the `master` branch

```
git checkout master
git merge my-new-branch
```

# Takeaways

.font110[
* Plain text is the best way to collaborate with your colleagues and your future self

* All tools we need are free, open source, and easy to use; they just take a bit of practice to get used to

* These tools are very robust, that is, you will likely be using them (or very similar ones) for years to come

* You will also quickly learn _how to think as a programmer_, and this has massive benefits for your future career

* You can use GitHub to [host your website](http://danilofreire.github.io) and use your projects [as your personal portfolio](https://danilofreire.github.io/pinochet/) 

* You can also _star_ someone else's repository and be up-to-date with the advances in your discipline! There are millions of interesting repositories there! 
]

---

# Homework

.font150[
* Create an account on GitHub and fork the `umbertolandia` repository (create your own copy)

* Create a Markdown file with sections, subsections, text, bullet points, an internet link, and a picture

* Add, commit, and push it into your fork 

* Show your repository to me tomorrow!

* Now that you know the tools we will use, tomorrow we start discussing how to write a scientific paper using RMarkdown+pandoc+GitHub!
