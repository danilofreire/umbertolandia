# Umbertolândia

This repository contains materials for a short-term, internal course targeted at
our research assistants at [Fundação Getulio Vargas](http://fgv.br). For
personal use only.

## Prerequisites

None. Anyone with basic familiarity with computers can follow the course. You
will need to install the following software to make the best use of the
materials:

* A text editor 
	- [RStudio](http://rstudio.com)
	- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
	- [Neovim](http://neovim.io)

* A [`LaTeX` distribution](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)

* [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) to convert `.md` files

* [Linux Libertine fonts](http://libertine-fonts.org/)

* The [xaringan `R` package](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) if you want to
	write some cool slides

* The [xaringan-metropolis
	theme](https://github.com/danilofreire/xaringan-metropolis), because it looks
	awesome

## Markdown

Please refer to the simple Markdown I've included in this repository if you need
to learn the basics of Markdown editing. It's available
[here](http://github.com/danilofreire/umbertolandia/why-markdown.md).

You can also find a lot of good information on Markdown on the internet such as
[this
cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
If you have any questions, just google your issue and you will probably find an
answer on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com).

## Anything else?

That's all you need! One good reference for using plain text tools in the social
sciences is this great book by [Kieran Healy](https://kieranhealy.org/), [_The
Plain Person's Guide to Plain Text Social Science_](http://plain-text.co/). It
covers pretty much all you need, even though he uses [emacs](http://emacs.org)
instead of [vim](http://vim.org), unfortunately. :smile:
